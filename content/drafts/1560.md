# Practical Rust Iterator Examples

Rust programming language has powerful mechanism of iterators to work with collections. Although documentation is fairly good, seeing working examples of iterators helps new learners of the language in grasping the concepts a lot. This post is a collection of rust iterator code snippets and their explanations. let longest_sequence_index = longest_sequence_counter.iter() .enumerate() .max_by_key(|&(index, &elem;)| elem) .unwrap() .0; //If you are transititoning from an imperative language to a functional one, first and most frequent thing to do is conve //One of the challenges in converting imperative loop constructs to their functional programming counterparts
